# Weight Lifting Exercise Prediction (Coursera Practical Machine Learning Course Project)

## Synopsis

Using devices such as **Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit** it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.

In this project, we are given with data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.**The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set.**

Following instructions have been given for the assignment -

1. Any of the other variables may be used to predict.

2. Report should describe -
a) How the model was built?
b) How cross validation was used?
c) What is the expected out of sample error?
d) Explaination about the choices made.

3. Prediction model should be used to predict 20 different test cases.

**We will build 3 models in this project using different Machine Learning Algorithms and cross validation and finally select the one with the least out of sample error. The best model will be used to predict different test cases.**
